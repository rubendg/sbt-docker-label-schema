[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rubendg/sbt-docker-label-schema.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rubendg/sbt-docker-label-schema)
[![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/rubendg/sbt-plugins/sbt-docker-label-schema/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/rubendg/sbt-plugins/sbt-docker-label-schema/_latestVersion)

sbt-docker-label-schema is a [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) plugin for automatically applying 
[label-schema](http://label-schema.org/rc1/) labels to Docker images created by the 
[sbt-native-packager](http://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/) plugin.

## Usage Instructions

In order to add the sbt-docker-label-schema plugin to your build, add the following lines to `project/plugins.sbt`:

```scala
resolvers += Resolver.bintrayIvyRepo("rubendg", "sbt-plugins")

addSbtPlugin("nl.rubendegooijer.sbt" % "sbt-docker-label-schema" % "0.1.1")
```

The plugin currently supports sbt versions `>= 0.13.16` and `1.x`, and is tested against `sbt-native-packager`
`1.2.2` and `1.3.3`. The plugin **does not** automatically include a dependency on the `sbt-native-packager` 
you'll have to do that yourself:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbt" %% "sbt-native-packager" % "1.3.3")
```

To see the result of activating the plugin run:

```bash
# docker image
sbt docker:publishLocal 

# and inspect the image's labels
docker inspect --format='{{.Config.Labels}}' "<IMAGE ID HERE>"
```

this will by default apply a sensible mapping from already existing sbt keys to [label-schema](http://label-schema.org/rc1/) labels.
You can further add to or override this mapping by modifying the `dockerLabelSchema` setting key, e.g. like this:

```scala
dockerLabelSchema in Docker := (dockerLabelSchema in Docker).value.copy(
  usage = Some("/usr/doc/app-usage.txt")
)
```

## Default mapping

This table describes the default mapping of SBT keys or otherwise to label-schema keys.
